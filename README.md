# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to predit credit risk using the credit card dataset from LendingClub. The data was very unbalanced, as low-risk applications outnumbers high-risk applications 197 to 1. I used RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids and SMOTEEN algorighm to balance the data and linear regression model to predict credit risk. I also used BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier models and commpared all six results to find out which model should be used to make predictions.
